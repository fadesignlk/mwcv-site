                    The Muslim Women's Council of Victoria Inc has a rich history rooted in community service.
                    Established as a not-for-profit organization, we were founded in 2002 under the name "The
                    Islamic Girls and Womenâ€™s Group (IGWG)." Over the years, we have evolved to meet the unique
                    challenges faced by Muslim women and members of disadvantaged communities throughout Melbourne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MWCV was founded and incorporated in Victoria on 4 April 2002. Our founding members began meeting in
                    April 2016, and since then, MWCV has played a pivotal role
                    in facilitating the integration of its members into the broader Australian community. Recognized
                    for its accomplishments, the IGWG has received accolades from Victoria University and the City
                    of Moreland for its efforts in promoting understanding and bridging gaps between Muslim and
                    non-Muslim communities.

                                    Since the start of the Covid 19 pandemic the work of MWCV has
                                    expanded further. During the first lockdown in April 2020 many people
                                    from disadvantaged communities including refugees, asylum seekers
                                    and international students were left in dire conditions due to sudden
                                    unemployment and lack of government assistance. Many desperate
                                    families and individuals reached out to MWCV in need of urgent food
                                    and aid. <br><br>

                                    After consultation with board members and the Moreland City Council,
                                    MWCV was able to start a Friday food kitchen from the Moreland Town
                                    Hall to provide hot halal meals and food packs for people in isolation and
                                    those that had lost all sources of income. <br><br>

                                    Starting with a small team of volunteers MWCV started from cooking 50
                                    meals a week and providing food packs for 50 families, the need quickly
                                    grew within a few weeks to providing in excess of 300 meals and 250
                                    food packs every week. <br><br>

                                    Unfortunately at the end of 2020 the premises had to be vacated and
                                    since then the Friday Food Kitchen has moved from one place to
                                    another but the needs of the disadvantaged members of the community
                                    has only grown. <br><br>

                                    In light of this the MWCV has decided to build a fully operational
                                    commercial size kitchen and distribution room in the land behind its own
                                    premises on 220 Moreland Road, Brunswick. <br><br>

                                    During the 2020/21 financial year, we made over 70,000 to 80,000
                                    meals and provided vulnerable people with 1,440 grocery packs. <br><br>

                        MWCV envisions a future where its services extend even further, transforming the food kitchen
                        into a neighborhood house. This expansion aims to provide counseling, financial literacy
                        support, legal services related to human rights and family issues, and basic training in
                        health-related matters. Specifically:
